# What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
<h4>Early adopter/fast adapter.</h4> 
You have an instinct for technologies and techniques, and you love trying things out. When
given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with
the rest of your knowledge. Your confidence is born of experience.<br>
<h4>Inquisitive.</h4> 
You tend to ask questions. That's neat—how did
you do that? Did you have problems with that library? What's this
BeOS I've heard about? How are symbolic links implemented? You
are a pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decision
years from now<br>
<h4>Critical thinker.</h4> 
You rarely take things as given without first
getting the facts. When colleagues say "because that's the way it's
done," or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems, you
smell a challenge.<br>
<h4>Realistic.</h4> 
You try to understand the underlying nature of each
problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult
things are, and how long things will take. Understanding for yourselfthat a process should be difficult or will take a while to complete
gives you the stamina to keep at it.<br>
<h4>Jack of all trades.</h4> 
You try hard to be familiar with a broad
range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep
abreast of new developments. Although your current job may require
you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas
and new challenges.<br>

# Building Your Portfolio

<h4>Invest regularly.</h4> 
Just as in financial investing, you must
invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly. Even if it's just a small
amount, the habit itself is as important as the sums. <br>
<h4>Diversify.</h4> 
The more different things you know, the more
valuable you are. As a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of
the particular technology you are working with currently. But don't
stop there. The face of computing changes rapidly—hot technology
today may well be close to useless (or at least not in demand)tomorrow. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the
better you will be able to adjust to change.<br>
<h4>Manage risk.</h4> 
Technology exists along a spectrum from risky,
potentially high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It's not a
good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might
collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and
miss out on possible opportunities. Don't put all your technical eggs
in one basket.<br>
<h4>Buy low, sell high.</h4> 
Learning an emerging technology before it
becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock,
but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learning Java when it first
came out may have been risky, but it paid off handsomely for the
early adopters who are now at the top of that field.<br>
<h4>Review and rebalance.</h4> 
This is a very dynamic industry. That
hot technology you started investigating last month might be stone
cold by now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database
technology that you haven't used in a while. Or perhaps you could be
better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that other
language….<br>

# Goals
Learn at least one new language every year. Different
languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning
several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking
and avoid getting stuck in a rut. Additionally, learning many
languages is far easier now, thanks to the wealth of freely available
software on the Internet <br>
Read a technical book each quarter. Bookstores are full of
technical books on interesting topics related to your current project.
Once you're in the habit, read a book a month. After you've masteredthe technologies you're currently using, branch out and study some
that don't relate to your project.<br>
Read nontechnical books, too. It is important to remember
that computers are used by people—people whose needs you are
trying to satisfy. Don't forget the human side of the equation.<br>
Take classes. Look for interesting courses at your local
community college or university, or perhaps at the next trade show
that comes to town.<br>
Participate in local user groups. Don't just go and listen, but
actively participate. Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out
what people are working on outside of your company.<br>
Experiment with different environments. If you've worked
only in Windows, play with Unix at home (the freely available Linux
is perfect for this). If you've used only makefiles and an editor, try an
IDE, and vice versa.<br>
Stay current. Subscribe to trade magazines and other journals
(see page 262 for recommendations). Choose some that cover
technology different from that of your current project.<br>
Get wired. Want to know the ins and outs of a new language or
other technology? Newsgroups are a great way to find out what
experiences other people are having with it, the particular jargon
they use, and so on. Surf the Web for papers, commercial sites, and
any other sources of information you can find.<br>
